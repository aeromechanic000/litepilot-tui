## Packaging and Publishing to npm

LitePilot can be installed via npm by bundling pre-compiled platform binaries behind a Node.js shim. The shim detects the user's OS and architecture, then executes the matching binary.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm (`npm login` to authenticate)
- Rust toolchain with cross-compilation targets installed
- GitHub Actions CI for automated builds (optional but recommended)

### Step 1: Create the npm package structure

```
litepilot-tui/
├── package.json
└── bin/
    ├── litepilot.js              # Node.js entry point (shim)
    ├── litepilot-darwin-arm64    # macOS Apple Silicon binary
    ├── litepilot-darwin-x64      # macOS Intel binary
    ├── litepilot-linux-x64       # Linux x86_64 binary
    └── litepilot-linux-arm64     # Linux ARM64 binary
```

### Step 2: Create `package.json`

```json
{
  "name": "litepilot-tui",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "description": "Terminal AI coding assistant powered by local Ollama models",
  "bin": {
    "litepilot": "./bin/litepilot.js"
  },
  "files": [
    "bin/",
    "README.md"
  ],
  "os": ["darwin", "linux"],
  "cpu": ["x64", "arm64"],
  "keywords": ["tui", "ai", "coding", "assistant", "ollama", "local", "terminal"],
  "license": "MIT",
  "repository": {
    "type": "git",
    "url": "https://github.com/aeromechanic000/litepilot-tui"
  }
}
```

Key fields:
- **`bin`**: Maps the `litepilot` command to the JS shim
- **`files`**: Only includes `bin/` and `README.md` in the published package (keeps it small)
- **`os` / `cpu`**: npm shows a clear error if installed on unsupported platforms

### Step 3: Create the JS shim (`bin/litepilot.js`)

```javascript
#!/usr/bin/env node
const { execFileSync } = require('child_process');
const path = require('path');

const platform = process.platform;
const arch = process.arch;

const platformMap = {
  'darwin-arm64': 'litepilot-darwin-arm64',
  'darwin-x64': 'litepilot-darwin-x64',
  'linux-x64': 'litepilot-linux-x64',
  'linux-arm64': 'litepilot-linux-arm64',
};

const binaryName = platformMap[`${platform}-${arch}`];
if (!binaryName) {
  console.error(`Unsupported platform: ${platform}-${arch}`);
  console.error('Supported: darwin-arm64, darwin-x64, linux-x64, linux-arm64');
  process.exit(1);
}

const binaryPath = path.join(__dirname, binaryName);
const args = process.argv.slice(2);

try {
  execFileSync(binaryPath, args, { stdio: 'inherit' });
} catch (e) {
  process.exit(e.status || 1);
}
```

### Step 4: Build platform binaries

Install cross-compilation targets:

```bash
rustup target add aarch64-apple-darwin
rustup target add x86_64-apple-darwin
rustup target add x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
rustup target add aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu
```

Build for each target:

```bash
# macOS Apple Silicon
cargo build --release --target aarch64-apple-darwin

# macOS Intel
cargo build --release --target x86_64-apple-darwin

# Linux x86_64
cargo build --release --target x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu

# Linux ARM64
cargo build --release --target aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu
```

> **Note**: Linux cross-compilation from macOS requires a linker. For `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`, install `brew install filosottile/musl-cross/musl-cross` and set `CARGO_TARGET_X86_64_UNKNOWN_LINUX_GNU_LINKER=x86_64-linux-musl-gcc`. Alternatively, build in CI on Linux runners.

Copy binaries into `bin/`:

```bash
mkdir -p bin
cp target/aarch64-apple-darwin/release/litepilot bin/litepilot-darwin-arm64
cp target/x86_64-apple-darwin/release/litepilot bin/litepilot-darwin-x64
cp target/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/release/litepilot bin/litepilot-linux-x64
cp target/aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu/release/litepilot bin/litepilot-linux-arm64
chmod +x bin/litepilot-*
```

### Step 5: Test the package locally

```bash
# Link globally to test the CLI
npm link

# Should launch LitePilot
litepilot

# Unlink when done
npm unlink -g litepilot-tui
```

### Step 6: Publish to npm

```bash
# Dry run to see what will be published
npm publish --dry-run

# Publish
npm publish
```

For scoped packages or first-time publishes:

```bash
# Public scoped package
npm publish --access public

# First time (if package name is taken, use a scoped name)
npm init --scope=@yourusername
npm publish --access public
```

### Step 7: Users install and run

```bash
# Install globally
npm install -g litepilot-tui
litepilot

# Run without installing
npx litepilot-tui

# Run in a specific directory
npx litepilot-tui -- -d /path/to/project
```

## Automating with GitHub Actions CI

Use CI to build binaries on native runners for each platform, then publish automatically.

### Release workflow (`.github/workflows/release.yml`)

```yaml
name: Release

      - run: |
          chmod +x bin/litepilot-*
          mv bin/litepilot-darwin-arm64/litepilot bin/litepilot-darwin-arm64
          mv bin/litepilot-darwin-x64/litepilot bin/litepilot-darwin-x64

      - run: npm publish
        env:
          NODE_AUTH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.NPM_TOKEN }}
```

Setup:
1. Create an npm access token at https://www.npmjs.com/settings/tokens
2. Add it as `NPM_TOKEN` in GitHub repo Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions
3. Tag a release: `git tag v0.1.0 && git push --tags`
4. CI builds all platforms and publishes to npm

## Version Updates

When releasing a new version:

```bash
# Update version in both files
# Cargo.toml: version = "0.2.0"
# package.json: "version": "0.2.0"

# Commit and tag
git commit -am "v0.2.0"
git tag v0.2.0
git push && git push --tags
```

## Test Cases for Usage

These test cases evaluate LitePilot's capabilities as a coding agent, benchmarked against what users expect from Claude Code, OpenAI Codex, DeepSeek-TUI, and Open Code. Organized by difficulty level.

### Level 1: Basic Capability

These verify the agent can handle fundamental coding tasks. Any mainstream agent should pass these.

| L2.11 | Database model | `Create SQLAlchemy models for User, Post, and Comment with relationships` | Foreign keys, relationships correct |
| L2.12 | CLI tool | `Create a Python CLI tool with argparse that converts CSV to JSON` | Proper argparse, handles file I/O, error messages |

### Level 3: Advanced Capability

Tasks requiring deep code understanding, cross-file reasoning, or architectural decisions. Competitive benchmark level — separates good agents from mediocre ones.

| ID | Task | Prompt | Pass Criteria |
|----|------|--------|---------------|
| L3.1 | Design a REST API from spec | `Design and implement a REST API for an e-commerce cart with product catalog, user auth stubs, and order management. Include proper HTTP status codes and error responses.` | 10+ endpoints, correct status codes, error handling |

| L4.5 | Debug subtle concurrency bug | `There's a race condition in the auto pipeline where syntax check runs before the file is fully written. Find it and fix it.` | Identifies the TOCTOU issue, proposes atomic write + check |
| L4.6 | DSL implementation | `Create a small domain-specific language for defining API routes in YAML, with a Python code generator that produces FastAPI boilerplate` | YAML parser, code generator, handles nested routes, type safety |
| L4.7 | Dependency upgrade migration | `Upgrade this project from reqwest 0.11 to 0.12, handling all breaking changes in the streaming API, timeout configuration, and error types` | All breaking changes handled, tests pass, no deprecated APIs |

### Level 5: Frontier Challenges

Tasks at the edge of current agent capability — difficult for Claude Code, potentially impossible for smaller models. These define the cutting edge.

| ID | Task | Prompt | Pass Criteria |
|----|------|--------|---------------|
| L5.1 | Distributed system | `Implement a Raft consensus library in Rust with leader election, log replication, and commit index tracking. Include a test harness that simulates network partitions.` | Correct consensus under partition, log consistency proof via tests |
| L5.2 | Compiler pass | `Write a type checker for a small ML-like language with algebraic data types, pattern matching, and Hindley-Milner type inference` | Type-safe programs accepted, type errors reported with locations |
| L5.3 | Full-stack app with auth | `Create a full-stack todo app: React frontend with state management, FastAPI backend with JWT auth, PostgreSQL schema, and Docker Compose setup` | 8+ files, 3 languages, working auth flow, deployable |
